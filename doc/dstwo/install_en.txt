To install:

Extract the _dstwoplug and TEMPGBA directories from the archive into your storage card's root directory, which is the directory that appears immediately after opening the storage card in a file browser.

To function properly, TempGBA also needs a dump of the GBA's BIOS. It is not
distributed in the release archive because of legal issues.

The file you dump or find should be 16 KiB (16384 bytes) and have the following
checksums:
* CRC32: 81977335;
* MD5: a860e8c0b6d573d191e4ec7db1b1e4f6;
* SHA-1: 300c20df6731a33952ded8c436f7f186d25d3492.

Once dumped or found, name the file gba_bios.bin, and place it in the
TEMPGBA folder extracted above.
